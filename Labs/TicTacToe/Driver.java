/**
 * TicTacToe -
 * The game contains a private 3-by-3 two-dimensional array for representing board elements.
 * An enumeration is used to represent the status of the final game result. The enumerationâ€™s
 * constants are named WIN, DRAW, and CONTINUE.
 * The game allows two human players to play the game. Whenever the first player moves, an X
 * is placed in the specified square, and an O is placed wherever the second player moves.
 * Each move must be to an empty square. After each move, it is determined whether the game
 * has been won or if there was a draw.
